            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello, My name is Ana Isabel, i'm from Braga and I graduate from ESEC, where I spent three incredibly
                enriching years.
                During this time I shared experiences with incredible people who crossed my path. My academic journey
                was more than just the pursuit of a degree;
                it was a time of discovery, challenges and maturing. Over these three years, I have not only acquired
                technical knowledge, but I have also grown as a person, shaping my view of the world and developing
                skills that go beyond the classroom. <br> <br> Now i'm ready for a new adventure!</p>
